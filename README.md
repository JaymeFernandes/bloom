# BLOOM

## The official bloom programming language repository.

This is a personal programming language project I'm working on. Feel free to try it out and give your opinions!


### **How to set up:**

- Clone the repository using git: `git clone https://github.com/Nauzoo/bloom.git`


#### - Instructions for Windows:

- Run this following command to create an executable file: `pyinstaller --noconfirm --onedir --console --icon "./assets/bloom_ico.ico" --name "BLOOM" --log-level "DEBUG"  "./source/interpreter.py"`
	- You need [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) to run this command.


- Add the folder containig "florish.ps1" to your enviroment variables:
 	![env](/assets/enviroment.png)


- You may also modify the path for your interpreter executable in "florish.ps1"
	![path](/assets/exe_path.png)


- You can now run `florish path_to_file.bloom` and start the interpreter.
